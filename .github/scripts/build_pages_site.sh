# build_pages_site.sh: assemble the progress dashboard into _site/
#
# Run by .github/workflows/pages.yml on a push to main. Layout produced:
#   _site/index.html          the dashboard page (docs/index.html)
#   _site/base/progress.json  the base target's data (docs/base/)
#   _site/base/PROGRESS.md
#   _site/progress.json       a root copy of the default target's data, the
#   _site/PROGRESS.md         page's fallback when a <slug>/ fetch misses
#
# Only the files named in DATA_FILES are published from each docs/<slug>/,
# not all of docs/: docs/ also holds the project's documentation, and a Pages
# deploy is public, so the served set is named rather than taken as a
# directory. A second target adds its slug to SLUGS.
