/* src/include/tlg_game_block.h: a block of the game's heaps and its release.
 * derived names throughout. A block carries a 16-byte header before it: a
 * tag byte, then at +0x2 the index of its owner in the table at 0x5943280. A
 * block tagged 10 whose owner is set goes back through slot 6 of the owner
 * with 1; any other goes to free. The release callback FUN_00ebf3f0
 * (leaf_00ebf3f0.cpp) is this body, and the destructors that own a block
 * inline it. */
